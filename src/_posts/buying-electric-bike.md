# My leap to e-bikes

I am from the Faroe Islands. It's a tiny spec in the North Atlantic. A small nation consisted of 18 islands, 17 of which are inhabited. One thing about living on a small island surrounded by Atlantic Ocean is that the weather can get extremely rough. In average it rains for 13 days out of the month, and most days are very windy by European standards. It goes without saying that almost nobody in the Faroes uses a bicycle as their main mode of transportation. The environment simply does not make it easy, even for rugged islanders.
