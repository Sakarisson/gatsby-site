## About me
      
Hi, my name is Kristian. I am a software engineer living in Helsinki,
Finland.
I am currently working at [Wolt](https://wolt.com/) where I develop frontend solutions using modern TypeScript.
I am a huge fan of React and its ecosystem and I like to explore and learn new technologies. In the past few years I have been specializing in React Native, and performant interactions and animations.
I have also been into powerlifting since 2011.
In the past I have worked as a GIS consultant and a web consultant, and I have always had a special place in my heart for all things JavaScript.
